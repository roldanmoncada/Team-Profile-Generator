# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description:

This application is a backend API for a web-based social network where users can share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and even create a friends list. This was done by using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB in tandem with Mongoose.

The functionality of this application will be displayed via video clip as requested by the assignment's Grading Requirements.

The assignment's User Story and Acceptance Criteria can be found in their own sections below.

## User Story:

```

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
